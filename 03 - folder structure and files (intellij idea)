- the "src" folder is place where we put our source codes
- ide will create "out" folder when we build / run our code

- *.iml file belongs to intellij idea, to keep state of project, we dont touch it, but we should ignore it in vcs
- same goes for .idea and out folders

- our source codes are .java files
- .class files are compiled version of our classes
- they are bigger in size

- after creating a new project:
-- go to project panel
-- right click to main folder
-- select "open module settings"
-- and make sure to "language level"
