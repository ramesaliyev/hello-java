- every whole number literal is actually an int and you should cast it before assign to types other than int or long.
- instance variables get defauls, but local variables dont.
- default of instance variables 0 for whole numbers (including char), 0.0 for decimals, and false for boolean
- use == to compare primitives and object reference check
- use equals() for string comparasion and object content check (how?)
