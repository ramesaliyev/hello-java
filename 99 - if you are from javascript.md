# THERE IS NO
- There is no `truthy` or `falsy` values, you can only use booleans or boolean expressions for conditional checks

# YOU CANT
- You cant call an argument-taker method without arguments.
- You cant shadow local variables within the code blocks in same scope.

# SAME
- Strings are immutable.
- Primitive types are value types and non-primitive types (including String) are reference types.
- Method calls by non-primitive types are done with reference pass.
