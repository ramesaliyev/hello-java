- first write java code in `.java` file
- executable file should have a class which have a `main` method
- class name and file name have to be same

- for example:
    `MyFirstJava.java`

        public class MyFirstJava {
            public static void main (String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Someone of the god!");
            }
        }

- compile it:

        javac MyFirstJava.java

- it will create `MyFirstJava.class` file in the same directory

- run it:

        java MyFirstJava

        > Someone of the god!

That's it! This is the way!
