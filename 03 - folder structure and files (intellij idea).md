- the `src` folder is place where we put our source codes
- ide will create `out` folder when we build / run our code
---
- `*.iml` file belongs to IntelliJ IDEA, to keep state of project, we dont touch it, but we should ignore it in VCS
- same goes for `.idea` and `out` folders
---
- our source codes are `.java` files
- `.class` files are compiled version of our classes
- they are bigger in size
