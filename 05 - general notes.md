- every whole number literal is actually an `int`
  - you should `cast it` before assigning to types other than `int or long`.
  - java will try to cast it automatically if you don't and if value doesn't fits to target data type, IDE will complain.
- every floating number literal is actually a `double`.
  - double is recommended to use always for floating-point numbers these days.
- for precise calculations, a class called BigDecimal should be used instead of float or double.

- use `==` to compare primitives and do an object reference check
- use `.equals()` for string comparison and object content check
---
- here is a [list of keywords of java](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Java_keywords)
---
- all classes in java are automatically inherited from java supplied class `Object`
- instance variables get defaults, but local variables don't.
- default of instance variables
  - `0` for `whole numbers` (including char),
  - `0.0` for `decimals`
  - `false` for `boolean`
  - `null` for `Class` therefore for `String`

- `method overloading`
  - providing two or more separate methods in a class with **same name** but **different parameters**. 
  - return type may or may not be different
  - may or may not have different access modifiers
  - **can** overload **static** and **instance** methods
  - method can also be treated as overloaded in the subclass 
  - **may** throw different exceptions
  - also known as **compile-time polymorphism**, because the compiler decided which method is going to be called based on the method name, return type and argument list. 
- `method overriding`
  - defining a method in the child class **that already exists in the parent class** with same signature (same name, same arguments)
  - **cant** override **static** methods, only **instance** methods can be overridden
  - return type **can** be a subclass of the return type in the parent class
  - **cant** have a **lower access modifier** 
  - **cant** override **constructors** and **private methods**
  - **cant** override methods that are **final**
  - methods which comes from the parent class known as **derived methods**
  - **must not** throw a new or broader checked exception
  - its recommended to use **@Override** annotation to make compiler show us an error if we dont follow the overriding rules correctly
  - also known as **runtime polymorphism** and **dynamic method dispatch**, because the method that is going to be called is decided at runtime by the JVM.
- `inheritance`
  - is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
- `composition`
  - is the design technique to implement has-a relationship in classes.
- `encapsulation`
  - is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
- `polymorphism`
  - is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. The word ‘polymorphism’ literally means ‘a state of having many shapes’ or ‘the capacity to take on different forms’. When applied to object-oriented programming it describes a language’s ability to process objects of various types and classes through a single, uniform interface.
  - An important example of polymorphism is how a parent class refers to a child class object.
  - There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
    - `compile-time polymorphism (static binding)`: **method overloading**
      - At compile time, Java knows which method to invoke by checking the method signatures.  So, this is called compile time polymorphism or static binding.
    - `runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding)`: **method overriding**
      - A call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime. As the method to call is determined at runtime, this is called dynamic binding or late binding.

- use `cmd + n`; `generate menu` to quickly generate getters and setters
- use `cmd + p`; to bring up parameter hints for methods calls
