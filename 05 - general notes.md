- every whole number literal is actually an `int`
  - you should `cast it` before assigning to types other than `int or long`.
  - java will try to cast it automatically if you don't and if value doesn't fits to target data type, IDE will complain.
- every floating number literal is actually a `double`.
  - double is recommended to use always for floating-point numbers these days.
- for precise calculations, a class called BigDecimal should be used instead of float or double.

- use `==` to compare primitives and do an object reference check
- use `equals()` for string comparison and object content check
